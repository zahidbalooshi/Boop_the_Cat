### *Description*
A simple Whack-a-Mole game but renamed to Boop-the-Cat – because we are not aggressive. Instead of whacking a mole, we’ll be booping a cat. The game will also have keyboard inputs for each “hole” for dynamic booping. The more you boop, the more points you earn – until the timer runs out!
***

### *How to Get Started*
Click “Start” button to begin. Boop the meow as they appear with either mouse clicks or keyboard buttons.

### *Pseudocode*
* The game will have a start button that will initiate the game.
* There will be a grid of 2 by 3, which will give us 6 "holes".
* We will have a function that will be showing the cat face in the holes for 0.5 seconds and then reassigning the cat to a different grid and this will be on a loop.
* There will eventListeners for mouse click as well as keyboard buttons (keyboard buttons will be assigned to specific grids and they won't change).
* There will be eventHandlers that will access the click/key event and perform function which will add to the score tally.
* There will timer counting down to zero. As soon as it hits zero, the game will end.
